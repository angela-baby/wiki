NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to 
work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use in-
faces to over 50 corpora(文集) and lexical(词典) resources
surch as [[WordNet]], along with a suite of text processing 
libraries for classifaction, tokenization([[分词]]), stemming, 
tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for 
industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion
forum.
